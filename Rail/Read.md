## A railgun, as said in the name, uses two electrically charged rails to propel a projectile.

Notes (Erick) - <br>
Lorentz Force Law/ Force of projectile = Current * length of projectile * Magnetic Field <br>
Amps >> everything else <br>
Capacitors most obv choice <br>
"Pulse power supply" also an option, allows small pulses of energy, minimizing losses, unlikely though<br>
